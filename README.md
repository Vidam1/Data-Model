#Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project.

The database is a star schema

To run execute etl.py

Sorry, busy to fill this out properly! :D


-- Note:
Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
Insert data using the COPY command to bulk insert log files instead of using INSERT on one row at a time
Add data quality checks
Create a dashboard for analytic queries on your new database
